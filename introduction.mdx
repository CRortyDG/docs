## Project Overview

Our project leverages WordPress as a headless CMS to manage and deliver content via a GraphQL API to a Next.js frontend. This setup allows us to decouple the content management system from the presentation layer, enabling greater flexibility, performance, and scalability.

### Key Features
- **Headless CMS**: WordPress manages content and serves it through a GraphQL API.
- **Next.js Frontend**: Modern React framework for building fast, server-rendered applications.
- **Custom Post Types and Taxonomies**: Extend WordPress's default post types and categories to better structure content.
- **Special Widgets**: Custom tools and features to enhance the website's functionality.

## Tech Stack Overview

### WordPress
WordPress is used as a headless CMS, managing content and delivering it via a GraphQL API. It allows for the creation of custom post types and taxonomies, making it easy to organize and retrieve content.

### Next.js
Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. It fetches data from the WordPress GraphQL API and renders it efficiently on the frontend.

### GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It serves as the bridge between WordPress and the Next.js frontend, providing a flexible and efficient data-fetching mechanism.

## Purpose of the Documentation

This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and working with our headless WordPress and Next.js project. It covers setup instructions, configuration details, and advanced topics to help developers get started quickly and make the most of the project's features.

### Objectives
- **Ease of Use**: Simplify the setup and development process with clear instructions and examples.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Document all major aspects of the project, from the tech stack to custom features.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the documentation to reflect changes and enhancements in the project.
